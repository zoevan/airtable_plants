This project combines [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).

Airtable is a relational database that is basically a sexier, more powerful version of Google sheets that is great for storing and organizing almost anything.

In this exercise, I'm using Airtable as an easy content management system for Jekyll in addition to Jekyll's built-in blogs function. This allows anyone with access to the base to edit or add records, and those changes will automatically appear on the site.

This [Plants Airtable Base](https://airtable.com/shrkyrmwA7q05dfqp) tracks care instructions for a small collection of houseplants.

The [Plant Care]({{ site.url }}/plants/) section of this site automatically generates one page per record in this base via a few custom plugins.
